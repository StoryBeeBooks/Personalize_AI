### The Problem: The "Personalization Gap"

Large Language Models (LLMs) have a "one-size-fits-all" personality, which creates a frustrating gap between a user's intent and the AI's output. This is a massive friction point for a rapidly growing user base, projected to be over 700 million weekly active users for ChatGPT alone [1].

This gap leads to:
*   **Wasted Time:** Users must constantly re-prompt and re-phrase to get the desired tone and format.
*   **Suboptimal Results:** Generic answers often miss the user's context, making them correct but not *useful*.
*   **User Detachment:** The impersonal experience feels robotic, leading to frustration and the feeling that the AI is not a true partner.

### The Solution: A Custom Communication Protocol

Personalize_AI solves this by translating your personal communication style into a set of clear instructions the AI can reliably follow.

**How It Works:**
1.  **Answer 8 Simple Questions:** A quick, non-technical questionnaire identifies your core communication preference on the **Executor vs. Collaborator** spectrum. This determines whether you want the AI to lead with clarifying questions or execute commands directly.
2.  **Generate Your Protocol:** We instantly generate a master prompt based on your answers, defining the AI's tone, format, and evidence requirements.
3.  **Copy & Paste:** Start your next LLM chat with your protocol to experience a dramatically more effective conversation.

Our approach is designed to enhance the most valuable LLM interactions. Research shows that "Asking" for decision support is consistently rated as higher quality by users than "Doing" (requesting a finished output) [1]. Our protocol gives you direct control over this crucial dynamic.
